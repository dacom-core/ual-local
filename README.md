# UAL for Local Authenticator

This authenticator is meant to be used with Local Authenticator and [Universal Authenticator Library](https://github.com/EOSIO/universal-authenticator-library). When used in combination with them, it gives developers the ability to request transaction signatures through a Local device using the common UAL API.
